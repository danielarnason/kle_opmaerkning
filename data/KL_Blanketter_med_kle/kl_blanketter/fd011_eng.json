The municipality or other public authorities are neither entitled to nor\nobliged to check whether your post in Digital Post has been read. This is the exact same situation as when your post arrives in your physical letter box.\nTherefore, you need to arrange with the person to whom you are granting reading access how you will be informed\nabout what the public authorities have written to you, if you do not read your post regularly. You also need to be aware\nthat if you have granted reading access to a company, the company itself can decide who in the company reads your\npost.\nDeleting reading access\n1.
